In mathematics, a [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_\(algebra\)) is a set equipped with a binary operation.

This code was used in investigations related to Terence Tao's [Equational Theories Project](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/).

Includes many methods for working with linear magmas, and especially equations 1518 and 677.

677_probably_nonlinear.txt contains magmas generated using magma cohomology by Matthew Bolan.

The order 125 model of 677 in magma125.in is due to Zoltan A. Kocsis.
