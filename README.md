In mathematics, a [magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_\(algebra\)) is a set equipped with a binary operation.

This code was used in investigations related to Terence Tao's [Equational Theories Project](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/).

Includes many methods for working with magmas, linear magmas (with operation x*y = ax + by in some ring, particularly finite prime fields), with special focus on models of equations 1518 and 677.

677_probably_nonlinear.txt contains magmas generated using magma cohomology by Matthew Bolan.

The order 125 model of 677 in magma125.in is due to Zoltan A. Kocsis.

The non-right-cancellative model of 677 in 677_non_right_cancellative.txt is an example of a construction due to Terence Tao and implemented by Matthew Bolan.

equations.txt is from the [equational theories](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories) repository.
